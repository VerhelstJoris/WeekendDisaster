  BillText: Australia and Africa have vast open plains that could be utilized for
    windmill parks.  These parks would not only be the largest of their type ever
    built but also be able to produce a significant amount of power for these nations.
    The drawback of course is that such a monumental undertaking would come at a
    significant cost.
