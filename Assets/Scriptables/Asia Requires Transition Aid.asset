  BillName: Asia Requires Transition Aid
  BillText: Asian power supply infrastructure is in trouble. Asian countries have
    both very high tech areas and big farm land with limited power supply and poor
    infrastructure. To be able to transition to renewable energy properly, these
    areas require a boost to decrease reliance on fossil fuels.
