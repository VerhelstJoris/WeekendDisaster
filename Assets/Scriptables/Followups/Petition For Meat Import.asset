  BillText: We proud Germans aim to set up a grand Oktoberfest this year. However,
    the bills passed by your legislation limit transport to such an extent that we
    cannot procure enough bratwurst in time. Please allow an exception over the coming
    months to be able to set up our traditional fest.
