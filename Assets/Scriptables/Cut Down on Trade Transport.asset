  BillName: Cut Down on Trade Transport
  BillText: Export and import is a major component of economy, but while the transport
    vehicles we use are as polluting as they are, we need to decrease the number
    of trucks and ships travelling each day. This should serve at least for a short
    term decrease in carbon emissions, but will require significant investment in
    local production.
